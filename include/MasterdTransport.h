 * the masterd over whatever networking code they like.
 *
 * This is a simple, polling class, designed with sessionless
 * protocols in mind. The current implementation uses UDP by way
 * of plib. One could "wrap" TCP to provide similar functionality,
 * though for masterd use this might be inefficient.
